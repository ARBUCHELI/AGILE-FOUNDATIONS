# 5. RESPOND TO CHANGE
----------------------

* Inspect and adapt
-------------------
Adapting to change is built into the very foundation of the Agile manifesto.

The developers who wrote the manifesto were already using their own software development methods.  Two of the most popular were SCRUM and EXTREME PROGRAMMING.  That's why a lot of Agile
teams use scrum terms.

* Agile Principle 2
-------------------
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.  Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

* SCRUM
-------
Sees itself as an empirical product delivery framework.

			* EARLY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOLLOWED THE SAME PROCESS THAT YOU HAD WITH MANUFACTURING, SO THESE TEAMS WOULD DEVELOP SOFTWARE THE SAME WAY YOU MIGHT
			BUILD A BRIDGE OR MANUFACTURE A CAR.

			* BUT AS TIME WENT ON, THESE TEAMS RECOGNIZED THAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS MUCH DIFFERENT FROM MANUFACTURING.  

			* SOFTWARE IS MUCH CHAOTIC.  THE PRODUCT MAY DEPEND ON DIFFERENT FACTORS THAY MAY ALWAYS BEEING CHANGED AND UPDATED:

				. Operating Systems.
				. Different networking protocols.
		
			* IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO PLAN OUT A WEB APPLICATION YEARS OR EVEN MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

			* EMBRACING CHANGE ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO BE MORE SATISFIED WITH THE FINAL PRODUCT.
