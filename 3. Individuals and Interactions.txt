# 3. INDIVIDUALS AND INTERACTIONS
---------------------------------

* The cost of multitasking
--------------------------

* Agile Principle 3
-------------------
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Shorter timescales = Sprints

* Scrum
-------
Avoid multitasking is a core idea of this framework.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Avoid work handoffs
---------------------

* Handoffs
----------
Finishing work on a task and then giving it to another person or department for processing.


* Queue size
------------
Batches of work that go through the system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Penny Game
----------------
The more productive way to work as an agile team is by moving around small batches of work and eliminating handoffs.  Even if your own productivity decreases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Deliver at a predictable pace
-------------------------------

* Agile Principle 8
-------------------
Agile processes promote SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. The sponsors, developers, users should be able to maintain a CONSTANT PACE indefinitely.

		Predictable = Sustainable-and-constant

* Sprint
--------
A timeboxed iteration of work intended to deliver a shippable portion of a product in a shorter time scale.

* Sprinkle
----------
Term from SCRUM that is being used here because SCRUM is the most popular Agile Framework.
	  -----					-----

	* AGILE TEAMS DELIVER IN SHORT TIME FRAMES

	* PREDICTABLE DELIVERY OVER A WELL-PLANNED PROJECT

	* PLANNING IS DIFFERENT THAN DELIVERING

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cross-functional teams
------------------------

* Agile Principles 5 and 11
---------------------------
Small, motivated self-organized team of generalists.

Agile teams should be cross-functional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* User stories
--------------

* Agile Principle 6 and Agile Value 2
-------------------------------------
Face-to-face communication and independence from documentation.

* Format for a user story
-------------------------
	
	As a [USER], I want [SOME FEATURE] so that I can [GET SOME VALUE].

* What vs. How ---> This is a concept that comes from SCRUM
--------------
The product owner worries about what the customer wants, and the development team decides how to deliver it.

* Remember that user stories are not an agile version of requirements.

* Requirements tell the developer exactly what to do.

* User stories allow to have a future conversation. It isn't designed to show the answers, but instead it helps the team to ask the right questions.
